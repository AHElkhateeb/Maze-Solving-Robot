# Maze-Solving-Robot
In this challenge, the robot is placed in an undisclosed maze. The goal is to find the target wall
with a specified color within the maze.

When the program starts, it shows a menu in which the target color can be selected. Once the user selects a color and presses enter, the robot begins to
search the maze for the correspondingly colored wall. The moment the robot starts moving, it produces a beep, and once the robot has found the target wall, it produces another beep.
There may be more than one colored wall, it is made sure that the right color is detected.

The following assumptions are made about the maze:
- It will be built in a grid system, where each tile is 35 cm × 35 cm in dimension.
- It consists of 3 × 4 tiles.
- It will be closed, so that the robot cannot leave the maze at any location.
- The maze does not contain loops.
- The target wall will be (one of the three walls) in a dead end.
- There may be other colored walls in the maze, but only one that has the specified color (of the target wall).
- The start position is not known.
